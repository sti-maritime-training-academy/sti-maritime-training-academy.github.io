# Scope

The **Bridge Resource Management** course introduces the concept of a navigation team to ship masters and watch officers and frames their decision-making process toward establishing watch conditions during the course of the voyage. Bridge Resource Management techniques will emphasize decision making based upon conditions related to workload and potential threat to the vessel. The intent of the course is to define the individual task and responsibilities of the various team members while developing a situational awareness to prevent individual errors. Our trainees can expect a high proportion of simulator time, interspersed with lectures on human factors and decision making.
